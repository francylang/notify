# NOTIFY

Notify is an interactive tool built for classroom teachers. It was created as a strategy for breaking down the barrier in communication between parents and teachers. Notify is meant to be a simple and efficient way for teachers to frequently communicate positive messages to parents/guardians.  It allows a teacher to give students points throughout class for demonstrating core values. Knowing that class rosters can change, teachers have the option to add and delete students as needed. When a student card is clicked, the teacher will be linked to the core values page for that individual student. It is here that teachers can add core value points. When a point is added, a text is sent to the parent/ guardian of that student with a message that indicates their student earned a point for demonstrating a core value.
